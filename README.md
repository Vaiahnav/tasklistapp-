Imagine you have a simple tool that helps you keep track of your to-do list. This program is like a digital notebook where you can add tasks you need to do, see what tasks are on your list, and remove tasks once you’ve completed them.

Here’s how it works:

Add Tasks: Whenever you think of something you need to do, you can easily add it to your list by typing it in.
View Tasks: If you ever want to see all the tasks you’ve added, you can view the entire list. Each task is numbered, so you know exactly what’s on your plate.
Remove Tasks: Once you finish a task, you can remove it from the list. You just need to enter the number of the task you want to remove.
The program runs in a loop, constantly waiting for you to tell it what you want to do next. It’s designed to be simple and straightforward, making it easy to manage your tasks without any fuss. Whether you’re adding new tasks, checking what you need to do, or marking things off your list, this tool helps you stay organized.
